## Introduction

Microservices architecture has become the de facto standard for building scalable applications. However, with great power comes great complexity. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore battle-tested patterns that help you build resilient microservices.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by monitoring service calls and "opening" the circuit when failures exceed a threshold.

```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime = 0;
  private state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN' = 'CLOSED';

  async call<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailureTime > this.timeout) {
        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
    }

    try {
      const result = await fn();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Event Sourcing

Event sourcing ensures data consistency across services by storing events rather than current state.

```javascript
// Event store implementation
class EventStore {
  async appendEvent(streamId, event) {
    const eventWithMetadata = {
      ...event,
      streamId,
      version: await this.getNextVersion(streamId),
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    await this.database.events.insert(eventWithMetadata);
    await this.publishEvent(eventWithMetadata);
  }
}
```

## Distributed Tracing

Implementing distributed tracing helps you understand request flows across services:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for Jaeger
version: '3.8'
services:
  jaeger:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    ports:
      - "16686:16686"
      - "14268:14268"
    environment:
      - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Service Boundaries**: Design services around business capabilities
2. **Data Consistency**: Use eventual consistency with compensation patterns
3. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive observability from day one
4. **Security**: Apply zero-trust principles with service mesh

## Conclusion

Building resilient microservices requires careful consideration of these patterns. Start simple, measure everything, and evolve your architecture based on real-world usage patterns.
