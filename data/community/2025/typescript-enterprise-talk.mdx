## Talk Abstract

After migrating a legacy JavaScript codebase of over 100,000 lines to TypeScript across 15+ microservices with a distributed team of 30+ developers, I've learned valuable lessons about what works, what doesn't, and what I wish I knew before starting.

This talk shares practical insights from the trenches of enterprise TypeScript adoption, including migration strategies, team onboarding, tooling decisions, and the unexpected challenges that textbooks don't prepare you for.

## Key Takeaways

### üè¢ Migration Strategy
- **Incremental vs Big Bang**: Why we chose gradual migration and how we made it work
- **Team Coordination**: Managing TypeScript adoption across multiple teams
- **Legacy Integration**: Strategies for working with existing JavaScript libraries
- **Timeline Reality**: Why our "6-month migration" took 18 months (and that's okay)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tooling & Infrastructure
- **Build Pipeline Evolution**: From Webpack to Vite, lessons learned
- **CI/CD Integration**: Type checking in continuous integration
- **IDE Configuration**: Standardizing development environments across teams
- **Monorepo Considerations**: Shared types, versioning, and dependency management

### üë• Team & Process
- **Developer Onboarding**: Training JavaScript developers in TypeScript
- **Code Review Evolution**: How type safety changed our review process
- **Documentation Strategy**: When types aren't enough
- **Performance Impact**: Build times, bundle sizes, and developer experience

### üìä Measuring Success
- **Bug Reduction**: Quantifying the impact on production issues
- **Developer Productivity**: Metrics that matter (and ones that don't)
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability improvements over time
- **Team Satisfaction**: Developer experience surveys and feedback
